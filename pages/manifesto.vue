                <br>
                <p>We are curious and believe that if one is earnest there will be more than growth awaiting your endeavor. Keep in mind, we don't believe this is a state that one inhabits constantly but integrity, compassion, diligence and deliberate action are born of earnest hearts.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our research question is: can living earnestly sustain a life, a couple, a family, a team, a company? Is it contagious? Inherited? How do you nurture it? When does it disappear? We will share our findings here and maybe a book, a podcast, a documentary, a travelogue. there will be a quiz.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We are a troupe of thinkers who love this earth and what people can do to affect brilliant beauty, change and lives well-lived. We rejoice in hopeful things and believe it is time to set our own course to usher in more hope by making some of our favorite earnest people and things they are doing known.
                    Stay tuned. #theearnestproject</p>
